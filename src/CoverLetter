Hello Mr/Ms. [Name], 

I am writing to express my interest in the web developer position at your company. As a 3rd year student at University of Florida, I have been working as a web developer for the past two years and have gained extensive experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs, Tailwind CSS, MongoDb, and NodeJs. I have also worked with other programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python during my coursework at UF.

My work has included developing websites from scratch, as well as maintaining existing sites. I have worked on both small and large-scale projects for personal and school areas. I have successfully developed a website for a local business, an online store for a dummy company, and a website for an organization at my university. I enjoy working in a team environment because it allows me to learn new things from others and improve my skills.

I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for this position. I am also eager to continue learning and growing as a web developer. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your company. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Moksh Keloo
