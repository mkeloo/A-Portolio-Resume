Hello Mr. Name, 

My name is Moksh Keloo and I am a 3rd year student at University of Florida. I have been working as a web developer for the past two years, and I have gained extensive experience to become proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs, Tailwind CSS, MongoDb, and NodeJs. I have also worked with other programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python during my coursework at UF. My work has included developing websites from scratch, as well as maintaining existing sites. 
My experience includes working on both small and large-scale projects for personal and school areas. I have worked on projects ranging from creating a website for a local business to developing an online store for a dummy company. I have also worked on projects that required me to work with an organization at my university to develop a website for them. I enjoy working in a team environment because it allows me to learn new things from others and improve my skills. 
I am confident that my skills and experience will allow me to be successful in this position. I am also confident that my enthusiasm and willingness to learn will help me grow into a valuable member of your team. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your company. Looking forward to discuss more about my experience with you. Thanks! Regards, Moksh Keloo
